# UE4-Stealth
This project is not finished yet. I am going to learn how and add the implementation of multiplayer (coop) as well as make a few different levels and add some other mechanics. Although core gameplay mechanics work fine. It features:

 * Simple AI that can spot player and react to sound
 * Simple UI that indicates AI state and tells current mission objective
 * Launch pads that can launch player or any physic simulating object.

I have learnt how to deal with animations and sounds in C++. I have improved knowledge about blueprint exposing, better class design and engine built-in functions.
